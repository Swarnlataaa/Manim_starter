In Manim Community Edition (ManimCE), you can add background music and sound effects to your animations, synchronize audio with your animations, export your animations to video files, choose video formats and quality, export animations for online use, and explore advanced topics such as shader animations, 3D animations, and advanced camera control. Let's dive into these advanced topics with detailed explanations and code examples:

**Adding Background Music and Sound Effects:**

You can add audio to your animations using ManimCE. To add background music and sound effects, you'll need to specify audio files and control their timing within the animation.

Here's an example of adding background music and a sound effect:

```python
from manim import *

class AudioExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Add background music
        background_music = AudioMobject("background_music.mp3")
        background_music.play()

        # Display text and sound effect
        text = Text("Sound Example")
        self.play(Create(text))

        # Add a sound effect
        sound_effect = AudioMobject("ding.mp3")
        self.play(Create(sound_effect))
        self.wait(1)
```

In this code, we use `AudioMobject` to add background music and a sound effect to the animation.

**Synchronizing Audio with Animations:**

To synchronize audio with your animations, you can use the `align_to()` method to align objects with specific audio cues. Additionally, you can use the `play()` method to control when audio plays relative to animations.

**Exporting Animations and Video Formats:**

You can export your animations to video files in various formats and qualities. ManimCE supports exporting to popular video formats such as MP4 and GIF. You can also control the quality and resolution of the exported video.

Here's an example of exporting an animation to an MP4 file:

```python
from manim import *

class ExportExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Your animation code

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Export the animation to an MP4 file
    config.pixel_height = 720
    config.pixel_width = 1280
    config.frame_height = 4.5
    config.frame_width = 8
    config.output_file = "output_animation.mp4"
    config.quality = "high"
    config.file_format = "mp4"
    config.renderer = "cairo"  # Use Cairo renderer for MP4
    os.system(f"manim -p -ql ExportExample")
```

In this code, we set the export parameters using `config` variables and specify the output file format as MP4.

**Advanced Topics in ManimCE:**

ManimCE supports advanced animation techniques and features:

1. **Shader Animations:** You can create shader animations to achieve complex visual effects, such as custom shaders for materials and lighting.

2. **3D Animations and Objects:** ManimCE supports 3D animations and objects. You can create and manipulate 3D objects in your scenes.

3. **Advanced Camera Control:** You can control the camera with precision, including specifying camera positions, angles, and zoom levels to achieve advanced camera movements and views.

Here's an example of advanced camera control:

```python
from manim import *

class CameraControlExample(ThreeDScene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create 3D objects
        cube = Cube()
        sphere = Sphere()

        # Position the camera
        self.set_camera_orientation(phi=PI/4, theta=PI/4)

        # Display objects
        self.play(Create(cube), Create(sphere))
        self.wait(1)

        # Move the camera to a different position
        self.move_camera(phi=PI/3, theta=PI/3)
        self.wait(1)
```

In this code, we use the `ThreeDScene` class to create a 3D scene, position the camera, and control camera movements.

These advanced features in ManimCE allow you to create complex animations with rich audio and video elements, as well as explore advanced techniques for advanced visuals and camera control.
